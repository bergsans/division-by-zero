It seemed like all the lowlifes in the city had crawled out to soak in a bit of darkness. A light rain fell
on the streets. But a sky-fall would be required to wash away all the scums standing in the street
corners, posing.

As if they were someone. But they're only a vermin of the cities, raw, crude existences with access to
high-tech gear. The rats of the middle ages. Besides the wizards, none of them could connect to the Link.

And this is why simple cops like me still are in demand, I thought. In the Link, everything and everyone is
controlled; all while lowlifes in the massive suburbs of New London persists in the shadows. They keep
lingering in a crude world, struggling for survival in what was previously labeled reality. Their refusal
to die is a bad parody of the real technologies available to the filthy rich.

My current task was to find one of the rats, an unenhanced commoner, named Frank, a renegade ex-military
cop. And why? Because some white-collar on the floor above suspected Frank had got hold of avant-garde
tech, making it possible to emerge unseen in the Link. And this the mega-cooperations would not tolerate.
Bad for business.`;

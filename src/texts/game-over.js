I am sorry, you died a horrible death. However, for a symbolic fee, we let you access your downloaded self
in a nice body. If not, we'll delete this temporary file.

Perhaps you'll do better the next round? You seem strong! You seem able! Souls INC. believe in you and got
you covered for a trifle, 30.000$.

Do you really want this to be the end? When accessing your downloaded self, Souls INC. throw in either a VR 
experience at Honolulu Bay or, if you pay an additional 10K, teleport you off-world to a real tropical paradise 
best experienced in flesh and blood... for that extra stimulation VR cannot produce with the same intensity.

Us working at Souls INC. got this. Choose life!
